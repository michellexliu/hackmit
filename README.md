## About Hack for IBS

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a serious health issue that affects millions of people. Hack for IBS aims to raise awareness for and destigmatize the living experiences of brave IBS warriors.

This project was created by Michelles Liu & Zhu for HackMIT 2022 under the Education track.
