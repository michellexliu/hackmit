        <h2>Fighting Symptoms</h2>
        <p>
          Fortunately, the symptoms can be mitigated by a healthy diet low on
          red meat, gluten, dairy and fried food. However, as you will see in
          the next section, this may not be the right choice for all.

          <p>
            For some, IBS can be nearly impossible to soothe. Furthermore, some
            warriors are focused on the gains, a dilemma which can be expressed
            in the figure below. These warriors deserve our support just as much
            as those who work to eradicate their disease.

        <h2>The Stigma around IBS</h2>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, IBS is yet another label which people use to
          discriminate against others and fence them into convenient areas of
          lower opportunity. If you are an IBS warrior, we beg of you to not be
          discouraged. We hope that this website and the following will give you
          some inspiration to fight on.

              In a more equitable world, JFK would’ve been known equally for his
              valiant battle with IBS as he was for his work and achievements in
              office.

              Tyra Banks is a longtime IBS warrior, but she hasn’t let that stop
              her from her EXPLOSIVE modeling career.

              Kurt Cobain’s diet of Kraft mac and cheese and Strawberry Quik
              were not beneficial for his IBS, but let this not detract from our
              respect for his warrior work.

          Before you move onward with your day, we encourage you to etch your
          support in stone by acquiring an IBS Awareness shirt in support. We
          look forward to the day when campuses across town will be awash with
          the noble blue ribbon of the IBS Warrior.
